# The creation of this blog

Published on: _Wednesday, January 11th 2023_

Welcome to my new blog! Here, I will go through the steps that I've taken to create this website.

**Why** have I chosen Astro? **How** did I do it? **What** is there to improve?

## Why Astro

Astro websites are _**FAST**_. Don't believe me? Throttle your connection and reload this page.

Astro offers a little sprinkle of every web framework. The possible integrations are endless.
<br>
You want to use React or Vue components? Go for it.
<br>
You want to style your website using Tailwind? Done.

Astro is easy to use and the documentation is amazing. If you're looking to build any kind of static website, give it a try. I promise you won't be disappointed.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: To add a blog post, I simply added a `.md` file in the `src/pages/posts` folder.

4. **Making reusable components**: I learned how to integrate reusable components into my project by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/components/` folder. They can then be imported into a page's frontmatter (the section of an Astro file reserved for your js) and used just like you would use a React component into the HTML.

5. **Making layouts for `.md` files**: I learned how to create and use layouts for my blog posts so they don't look blend when you visit them.

## What's to improve

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
